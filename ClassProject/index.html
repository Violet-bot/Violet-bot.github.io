<p>There are many competitions in college. Please 
    show off the talents you have. In many competitions 
    in the university, there will be many attractive prizes to attract us, 
    such as SLR, iPhone and so on. Of course, I'm not talking about how important
     it is to win the prize, but during the competition, you will show your
      confidence and practice your manners on the stage. You will become a better
       person over and over again during the competition. The ranking of the 
       competition is not so important, but the process is the most important.
